# TheCoachesCage

This is an application to help rowing coaches organize their day-to-day practices. It uses React, Express, Node, and a PostgreSQL database. HTML5 Drag&Drop is functional on desktop. An in-the-works csv parser allows coaches to submit rosters and workouts with total flexibility in the information they submit, and allows easy tracking of athletes. Athletes can be sorted by any part of any workout, and by different categories of eligability.

TODO: 
- Mobile Drag&Drop.
- Drag&Drop integration for easy file input.
- Google Maps integreation, along with a weather API, for coaches to plan their practice and get alerts on incliment weather where they'll be, when they'll be there.
- A pop-up modal to track individual athletes over time, on their own or against the team in general.
